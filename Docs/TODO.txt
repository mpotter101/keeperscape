2023 Sep 6
	Ended up scrapping the shelled out project. Tools don't help when there isn't a game to build them for.
	Updated project is based on "Old School Essentials - Advanced Fantasy" rule set.
	
	Core - Online Co-Op Dungeon Crawler
	Layer 1 - Long-format rewards with some kind of in-game shop
	Layer 2 - Support for playing from Phone (maybe different phone-specific asymmetrical classes)
	Layer 3 - Asymmetrical Versus mode
	Layer 4 - More relaxed ways to engage with the game
	
	Remaining Technical Needs:
			// Websockets
		[ ] Browser-side Network Manager
		[ ] Server-side Network Manager
			// ---
			
		[ ] Client Player - sends data to network manager
		[ ] Network Entity - receives data from network manager and updates related objects
		
		[ ] Configurable controls
			- mouse sensitivity
			- Key to Action Name converter (like unity axis)

	Game Needs:
		[v] Design for setting up character for account - could be handled on a separate web page
			- Just needs to consist of a name and color for now.
			solution : re-purposing my previous spriting tool.
		[ ] Design for lobbying with players - could be handled on a separate web page that launches into the game
			- Pick your character here
			- See other player's selected character
			- Ready Up + Host Force Start (whoever makes the lobby is the host)
		[v] Structure for game assets + anticipated pipeline (allows me to design a game specific object for easily integrating new assets)
			for assets, can have multiple pages with the incarnation tool using different configs (and different styles)
			to create uploaders for:
				- static assets
				- interactables like chests
		
	Need to test bringing in live2d stuff

		[ ] Add small dash with kick (melee while in air)
			( ) Hitting something propels you away and up
	
	Testing Milestone
		[v] Sandbox environment for testing mechanics
		
	Weapons Milestone
		[ ] Add two guns
			( ) using same mesh, but have different stats/names
		[ ] Gun can be picked up
			( ) Pick-up controls (q/e or u/o)
		[ ] Gun can be fired
		[ ] Gun can be thrown
			( ) Pick up controls become throw controls for occupied hand
	
	Combat alpha Milestone
		[ ] Create target dummy (probably using Runt mesh)
		[ ] dummy reacts to damage
		[ ] ground pound dummy causes it to drop ammo
		
	Combat beta Milestone
		[ ] Create enemy mob (Under Elf)
		[ ] Mob can shoot at player
		[ ] Mob KO's when out of health
		[ ] Mob fires periodically
		[ ] Mob has faulty accuracy
		[ ] Mob has a reaction time
		[ ] Mob cannot shoot for a small period when melee'd
		[ ] Mob moves periodically to avoid incoming fire
		[ ] Add predictive aiming to AI by getting player's movement delta and apply it to their current position
