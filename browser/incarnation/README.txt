This is an update to my previous sprite-uploader "Vile Spawn"
https://github.com/mpotter101/Vile-Spawn

The previous version uses things like web-pack and babel for creating built-down versions of the project.
Updating to use my new setup to not need so many pipeline tools.

Additionally, Vile Spawn was previously intended for an isometric game, this version is meant for a more "doom-like" approach.
